This is a study project made to develop ReactJS and learn it's concepts.

In this project I've build a ReactJS in this project i've made a personal blog using github api to retrieve the issues as a way to publish posts, I've also added
a filter to only show issues with the published tag so i can do post drafts and control what is shown in the post's feed. The main go here was to learn about REST API's
and it's concepts.

The whole project keeps in mind accessibility too, you can navigato through the app with the keyboard with no problem at all.

For UI/UX design we use Figma with the design build to guide.
